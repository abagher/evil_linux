Evil Linux
----------

This project is a proof-of-concept showing how easy it is for system administrators (or any so-inclined `sudo`er, really) to steal your sensitive data, including passwords. With very minor changes to several core Linux libraries/programs, they can be made to covertly record sensitive data an unsuspecting user passes to them, while remaining functionally unchanged otherwise.

Several examples are provided, including:

  - Evil PAM
  - Evil OpenSSL
  - Evil Mail
  - Evil Bash
  - Evil Firefox (cookie stealer)
